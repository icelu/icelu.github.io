I am currenly a [Surrey Future Fellow](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/research/work-with-us/research-fellowships) at [Section of Systems Biology](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/school-biosciences/research/section-systems-biology) University of Surrey. 

__I will start my own research group and please do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in my research.__
Details of potential projects will come up soon! 

Previously, I was a Postdoc in [Chris Barnes’s group](https://ucl-cssb.github.io) at Department of Cell and Developmental Biology University College London, where I have been working on dynamical modeling of chromosomal instability (CIN) in cancer genomes. Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Genome Institute of Singapore ([Weiwei Zhai’s Group](https://zhailab.cn/)), where I mainly developed pipelines and methods to analyse tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution in liver and lung cancer genomes. I completed my PhD in Computational Biology under the supervision of [Hon Wai Leong](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leonghw/) at School of Computing National University of Singapore, where I developed machine learning and phylogenetic methods for problems related to lateral gene transfer. I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degree from Software Engineering Institute East China Normal University, where I led the development of platforms for high-throughput biological data analysis, including RNA-Seq and proteomic data.

My research is in the broad field of computational biology, which bridges software engineering, machine learning, algorithms, statistics, phylogenetics, population genetics, and omics. I am particularly interested in developing new computational methods and models to address important biological problems related to human health. My goal is to facilitate the mining of new knowledge from the accumulating huge amounts of data for the biological and biomedical community. I have developed several new methods and applied available methods to tackle basic questions arising in the study of species and cancer evolution. My current primary interests are evolutionary dynamics of cancer genomes, especially those driven by CIN, which are still less well studied than point mutations but critical in tumorigenesis and patient treatment.
