I am a Postdoc in [Chris Barnes’s group](https://ucl-cssb.github.io) at Department of Cell and Developmental Biology University College London since Jan 2019, where I have been working on dynamical modeling of chromosomal instability in cancer genomes. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Genome Institute of Singapore (Weiwei Zhai’s Group), where I mainly worked on analyzing tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution in liver and lung cancer. I completed my PhD in Computational Biology under the supervision of Hon Wai Leong at School of Computing National University of Singapore, where I developed machine learning and phylogenetic methods for problems related to. I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degree from Software Engineering Institute East China Normal University, where I led the development of platforms for high-throughput biological data analysis, including RNA-Seq and tandem mass spectrometry data.

My research is in the field of computational biology, which bridges programming, software engineering, machine learning, algorithms, statistics, phylogenetics, population genetics, and omics. My work span across platform and pipeline development, data analysis, method development and benchmarking, and data modeling. I am particularly interested in developing computational methods to solve important biological problems related to human health. I have developed several new methods and applied available methods to tackle basic questions arising in the study of species and cancer evolution.
